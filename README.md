## Requirements

The Unfiltered Theme requires the Genesis Framework which can be purchased at http://www.studiopress.com/.

## Terms of Use

**The Unfiltered Theme does not include support.**

In an attempt to make the world a better place and to pay it forward, I decided to make this theme free to download. I poured my heart and sould into this design, so please respect this decision to make it available by using it "as is."

I'll be updating this theme frequently, so it's up to you to identify any changes and apply them on your own.

**I reserve the right to modify these terms or remove the theme entirely from Github at my discretion.**

## Theme Setup

The Unfiltered Theme was meant to be minimal. Some functionality and features of the Genesis Framework have been removed.

**Site Title**

Simply add a text widget into the Header Right widget area. Below is the code that I've used on my own blog:

```
<h1 class="site-title" itemprop="headline"><a href="http://unfiltered.me/" title="Unfiltered"><span class="header-un">Un</span><span class="header-filtered">filtered</span></a></h1>
```
